    "\n",
    "Congratulations! You've made it through another _intense_ module, and now you're ready to show off your newfound Machine Learning skills\n",
    "\n",
    "All that remains in Phase 3 is to put your new skills to use with another large project.\n",

    "## Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll work through the entire data science process to solve a **classification** problem using a **dataset you choose**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Business Problem and Data\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to:\n",
    "1. Define a stakeholder (who cares about the problem).\n",
    "2. Identify a business problem.\n",
    "3. Choose a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more details, check [Phase 3 Project - Choosing a Dataset](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-phase-3-choosing-a-dataset).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember the difference between *classification* and *regression*:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Classification**: Target variable is a *category* (e.g., Yes/No, Red/Blue).\n",
    "- **Regression**: Target variable is a *numeric value* (e.g., price, height).\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, you must work on a **classification problem**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Findings and Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "In previous projects, you focused on understanding data (descriptive and inferential). Now, you should also use a ***predictive*** approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "Predictive *findings* might include:\n",
    "- How well your model predicts the target.\n",
    "- Important features for your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Predictive *recommendations* might include:\n",
    "- When your model's predictions are useful.\n",
    "- How the business can change inputs to get desired results.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Iterative Approach to Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to build multiple models. Start with a basic model, evaluate it, and then improve it. Discuss your final model in 1-3 paragraphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Explore:\n",
    "1. Model features and preprocessing.\n",
    "2. Different models (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees).\n",
    "3. Different model settings (hyperparameters).\n",
    "\n",
    "You must build at least two models:\n",
    "- A simple baseline model (e.g., logistic regression).\n",
    "- An improved version with tuned settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Classification Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose the right metrics to evaluate your models. Use these metrics to assess performance on both training and testing data."

    "\n",
    "You need to submit three things:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A **non-technical presentation**\n",
    "2. A **Jupyter Notebook**\n",
    "3. A **GitHub repository**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Non-Technical Presentation\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a slide deck for business stakeholders. Present it live and submit a PDF on Canvas. Follow this structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Beginning**\n",
    "   - Overview\n",
    "   - Business and Data Understanding\n",
    "2. **Middle**\n",
    "   - Modeling\n",
    "   - Evaluation\n",
    "3. **End**\n",
    "   - Recommendations\n",
    "   - Next Steps\n",
    "   - Thank you\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain classification modeling in simple terms. Assume the audience knows little about machine learning. Translate metrics and features into plain language.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook uses Python and Markdown to present your analysis to a data science audience. Submit it in PDF format on Canvas and `.ipynb` format on GitHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "Include these sections:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Business Understanding\n",
    "- Data Understanding\n",
    "- Data Preparation\n",
    "- Modeling\n",
    "- Evaluation\n",
    "- Code Quality\n",
    "\n",
    "### GitHub Repository\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where you store all your project files and their version history. Follow the same requirements as in Phase 1 and 2, but include these sections in the `README.md`:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Overview\n",
    "- Business and Data Understanding (explain your stakeholder and dataset choice)\n",
    "- Modeling\n",
    "- Evaluation\n",
    "- Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The `README.md` should bridge your non-technical presentation and the Jupyter Notebook. It should explain your methodology and analysis in more detail than the slides but without the code.\n",

    "\n",
    "To pass, you must meet each project rubric objective for Phase 3:\n",

    "* **Rationale:** Why use machine learning instead of simpler analysis?\n",

    "* **Results:** Describe the classification metrics.\n",
    "  * Report multiple metrics but explain why you chose them.\n",
    "  * For business audiences, connect metrics to real-world implications without technical details.\n",
    "  * For data scientists, explain why you chose specific metrics.\n",
    "* **Limitations:** Identify limitations or uncertainties in your analysis.\n",
    "  * Are there records where the model performs worse? What problems might this cause in production?\n",
    "  * Be more detailed for data scientists and simpler for business audiences.\n",
